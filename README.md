# Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

although I have been really enjoying VITE with React, I decided to use old faithful for this application

This was based off a tutorial I did a few months back by [Code Commerce](https://www.youtube.com/@codecommerce) but was done standalone to see what I was able to maintain without using the entire video, although I did have to go back to the video to remember how to set up the numbers to show as Imperial rather than Kelvin.

## Weather App with API

This is just a simple demo app that shows the weather at a given location

using the Openweather API [here](https://openweathermap.org/current)

nothing else super special about said application, just something I built to help me understand how APIs work within React and JavaScript

although the app itself is simple and more than likely has a few bugs inside of it, the main idea was to get the api to send data, and the app to display the data in an open reactive way, this was accomplished

I have been learning front end development using JavaScript to expand my abilities and to help learn back end development which is my true passion, but I figured Understating how the front end would interact with a backend / backend API is going to help me understand the best way to design and build back end services

## Used Create React App

which means If you want to check out the app you can clone the repo

cd into the project and run NPM start and it should load up. designed for Moblie or small screens in mind, but can be used on desktop platforms as well. It uses a limited flexbox outline, but it will work in any environment needed.
